# Matthew

Hi, my name is Matthew :raising_hand:. I am a simple and performant mesh viewer based on nanogui and openGL.
My task is to quickly show surface meshes to view the contents. I also compute basic mesh properties like curvatures
and I can remesh and improve meshes. Recently, point cloud support was added. I can now also show point clouds without structure information.

I can read:
 - Wavefront (_*.obj_)
 - Object File Format (_*.off_)
 - STL (_*.stl_)
 - Point Cloud Data (*.pcd)
